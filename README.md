# HashCraft Discord Bot - DuinoCoin Faucet
A Duino-Coin Faucet in the form of a Discord Bot.

This is my first JavaScript Project, Specifically NodeJS. I am quite happy with how this project has become now.
<br>

# Features

This faucet uses an in-system currency called mDU (Symbol: ⧈). The current conversion rate is 1 DUCO = 100 ⧈ mDU
1. Account linking: Link and Un-Link your Duino-Coin Accounts to the Bot's Database using `/link`
2. Faucet Claim: Get your daily drop of ⧈ mDU using `/claim`. The current drop amount depends on two mathematical formulae, for an optimal drop rate.
3. Balance Check: Check how much ⧈ mDU you have using `/balance`
4. Exchange ⧈ mDU for DUCO using `/deposit`
5. Bot status can be viewed using `/stats`
6. You can also view a bunch of other DuinoCoin Faucets simly using the command `/faucetlist`

You can use the faucet [in the HashCraft Discord Server.](https://discord.gg/vH8fxYZcr8)
